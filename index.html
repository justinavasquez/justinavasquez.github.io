<span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Do North Carolinians understand the economics of their home loans?</h3>

<p>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — This week, the Federal Open Market Committee decided against raising the federal funds rate from its 
target range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent.</p>

<p>The FOMC, the executive policy making body of the U.S. central bank system, instead intends to support relatively low interest rates 
and maintain consumer and capital price levels across the U.S., according to a press release from the Federal Reserve System.</p>

<p>While this could mean stagnation for the economy, the homebuyer’s market is benefitting, largely due to partnerships between government
home mortgage managers and corporate investors.</p>

<p>These government mortgage mangers consist largely of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, together selling 57.7 percent of home loans worth a 
total of $6.29 million issued in Durham County alone. For this reason, Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie 
Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) are big players in the secondary mortgage market.</p>

<h4>Everyone gets a piece of the mortgage pie</h4>

<p>The mortgage process usually begins with familiar names: a local credit union or bank that offers homebuyers a loan. According to data 
collected by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 45.1 percent of home loan applications were 
approved in North Carolina in 2014, the most recent year data was collected.</p>

<p>But homebuyers are rarely familiar with how the life of their mortgages will look and how the larger economy can affect their mortgage 
payments.</p>

<p>“Most homebuyers don’t know and don’t care,” said one Cary-based real estate agent.</p>

<p>Norman Block is an owner and manager at Block Associates Realty and a professor in the real estate program at UNC-Chapel Hill’s 
Kenan-Flagler Business School. “Unfortunately, they approach it like buying a car.” He said homebuyers care more about the down payment 
and monthly payment on a home than how to get the most out of what could be a long-term investment.</p>

<p>Because of this — and because there is no federal law preventing it — homeowners are typically oblivious when their mortgage lender 
sells their mortgage to a third-party investor like Fannie Mae.</p>

<p>Once a mortgage lender approves and accepts enough home loans, possibly hundreds or thousands according to Investopedia.com, the lender 
bundles them and sells them to regain money that it can again loan out to other homebuyers.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, 49.8 percent of loans were accepted and 44.9 percent were sold to third parties in 2014. Of those, 69.3 percent 
were sold to government investment corporations like Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac. A combined 23.4 percent were sold to banks, 
credit unions insurance companies and finance companies.</p>

<p>Scott Frame, financial economist and senior adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said this is common and has been happening 
for roughly 30 years.</p> 

<p>The U.S. Congress passed multiple laws in the 1980s and 1990s loosening and tightening the mortgage lending and purchasing markets, 
including the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act, the Home 
Ownership and Equity Protection Act, and as early as 1975, it passed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the laws also created a gateway for lenders to offer loans to a large number of homebuyers who either didn’t have strong 
enough credit scores or had weaker income than would be necessary to accommodate their loans’ interest rates. These types of loans are 
called subprime, and they’re the reason the U.S. economy crashed nine years ago.</p>

<p>Brad Thomas, writer for Forbes’ “iREIT Investor,” visited UNC-Chapel Hill as a guest lecturer in April and said in an interview 
afterward that the growing number of subprime loans in Durham looks like a newer iteration of Michael Lewis’ “The Big Short,” a book 
and film about the 2007-2008 Great Recession.</p> 

<p>But both Thomas and Frame agree Durham’s mortgages aren’t quite subprime.</p> 

<p>Thomas said the façade stems largely from changes in credit score requirements for home loans.</p>

<p>“The argument is, ‘Are we moving back to the ‘Big Short’? Is it getting too frothy? Are the standards loosening?’ My answer is no, 
they’re not loosening.”</p>

<p>Thomas explained that mortgage lenders are accepting homeowners’ applications with lower credit scores than just a few years ago 
because it takes seven to 10 years for an individual’s credit score to recover from periods like the Great Recession. This way lenders 
can make a profit and borrowers aren’t denied a home purchase due to their recovering but relatively average credit scores.</p>

<p>“This is not another apocalypse ‘Big Short,’” said Thomas.</p>

<p>Scott Frame said low credit scores along with low applicant income are to blame, the same low credit scores and low applicant income 
that flowed through the mortgage market floodgates Congress opened decades ago.</p>

<p>According to research conducted by Fannie Mae, many homebuyers today, about 36.9 of them, are between the ages of 25 and 34, and they 
depend on their parents to help them afford the down payments and closing costs on their new homes. Still, Fannie Mae reported the number 
of homeowners in this age range was 10 percentage points higher in 2006. Although the economy has improved since the housing bust, young 
adults’ have yet to reach the financial strength of the typical homebuyer before the housing bubble.</p>

<p>In 2006, North Carolina home loans purchased by Fannie Mae saw credit scores as low as the upper 400s and none above 850. Of the 
mortgages Fannie Mae purchased in 2014 the lowest credit score was 611. In 2015, the lowest credit score increased to 635 with still 
none above 850.</p>

<h4>Lower rates mean greater benefits</h4>

<p>Rather than alarmed by mortgage practices, North Carolina’s housing market experts seem interested in the learning and investment 
opportunities these practices present.</p>

<p>“I do believe it’s still a very good time to buy a home,” Norman Block said. Low interest rates were his primary reason. He explained 
that interest rates on mortgages are currently at about 3.5 percent of the loan, and that’s the lowest they’ve been in Block’s 30 years 
as a real estate agent. “People can buy more house today than they can when rates go up.”</p>

<p>Block predicts that after the presidential election this year, the 
Federal Open Mark Committee will raise interest rates and return mortgage rates to their typical 6 percent. This would mean that for any 
given homebuyer willing to pay, say, $1200 each month on their mortgage, today that homebuyer could purchase a $267,000 home, whereas in 
a year that homebuyer would only be able to afford a $200,000 home.</p>

<p>Block thinks financial literacy is just as important as knowing how to benefit most from investing in a home.</p>

<p>The North Carolina Department of Justice has a series of tip sheets for consumers of all products, including homes, to ward off scams 
and help consumers make informed decisions. Chief among them, “Ask each lender and broker for a list of current mortgage interest 
rates.”</p>
